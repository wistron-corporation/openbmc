DESCRIPTION = "Generates bindings against sdbusplus for dbus APIs"
## The sdbusplus repository has an Apache LICENSE file, which we would
## normally check here, but the python setup script is in a subdirectory
## which requires us to set ${S} below.  When we change ${S} from the root
## of the repository, bitbake can no longer find the LICENSE file.  Point
## to the common Apache license file in poky's meta instead.
